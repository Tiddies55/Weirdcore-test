<h2>What is Weirdcore?<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Weirdcore"target="_blank" title="html5 specification"></h2><u><strong>Weirdcore</a></strong></u> is an online aesthetic and art movement centered around amateur or low-quality photography and/or digital graphics that have been constructed or edited to convey feelings of confusion, disorientation, alienation, and nostalgia or anemoia.<p>Visually, it is strongly influenced by the general look and feel of images shared on an older internet, roughly a period spanning from around the late 90's to mid 2000's. Amateur editing, primitive digital graphics, lo-fi photography and image compression are some of the most common elements found in Weirdcore images.</p>
